#+title: Dockerized snort3

This is a dockerized setup of =snort3=. It is geared toward checking a
directory of .pcap-files but can be used for "online-mode" as well.

* Usage
To check .pcap-files in =./pcaps= using the Snort-rules in
=./etc/rules/snort.rules=, just run:
#+begin_src shell
docker-compose up
#+end_src
This will append the arguments in the =command=-field of the
=docker-compose.yml= to the =entrypoint= specified in there.

Alternatively, you could use, the =docker-compose run=-command naming
the service to pass custom options to the entrypoint to achieve the same:
#+begin_src shell
docker-compose run snort3 -r /tmp/test.pcap
#+end_src

To run =snort3= in continuos online mode, run the following command.
#+begin_src shell
NIC="eth0" # or another NIC available on the host machine
docker-compose run snort3 -i ${NIC}
#+end_src
